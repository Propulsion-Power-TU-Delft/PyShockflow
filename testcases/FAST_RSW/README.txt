Slightly different initial conditions than testcase_01. Only to assess robustness of inputs.

Test case relative to FAST experiment (screenshot in the folder). Interface in the middle, no nozzle, and flow initialized with values for pre and post RSW.
If the RSW is properly resolved, the wave should remain intact, and move to the left at a speed slightly higher than the speed of sound in the state A.
The plots show that this is the case. The solver is in theory capable of resolving RSW.
